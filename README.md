# Heroes and Villains - Campus Edition

*Written by Manu Hamblyn and Jesse Sheehan*

This document should serve as a general guideline for polishing the game after everything is working properly.


## Students (Heroes)

There are several different types of Students in our game. Each student has a name, a major (HeroType) and health. Students have a special ability which depends upon their major.

## Majors (HeroTypes)

### **Engineering**

**Flavour Text:** An engineering student's hygiene is usually as good as their social skills, this can be used to their advantage. Software engineering is not a real engineering discipline and isn't included (see Computer Science).

**Ability:** *Bad Odour* - Villains are repulsed by the Engineering student's lack of hygiene and are afraid to get too close. Engineers take 20% less damage.

### **Computer Science**

**Flavour Text:** Mainly introverts, computer science majors spend their spare time honing their computer skills instead of socialising. The computer science department includes software engineering.

**Ability:** *Hack the System* - Computer Science students can edit the game's code, allowing them to skip one Villain fight.

### **Arts**

**Flavour Text:**

    There once was a fella named Terry,
    Who thought that English sounded rather cheery.
    The top of his class,
    He easily passed.
    And now he works down at the dairy.

**Ability:** *Throw Money* - Literally throws money away, having no positive effect on the game whatsoever. No one knows why they keep doing it. May occassionally have an additional effect *Waste Time* that hangs the game for several seconds.

### **Mathematics/Statistics**

**Flavour Text:** TODO

**Ability:** *Improve Odds* - Using rigorous statistical method, these students have figured out how to improve their odds in some games.

### **Sciences**

**Flavour Text:** TODO

**Ability:** *Quick Recovery* - TODO ... doubling the recovery rate of all team members.

### **Law**

**Ability:** *Objection* - Your team cannot be robbed when travelling to a new building.


### **Commerce**

**Flavour Text:** TODO
